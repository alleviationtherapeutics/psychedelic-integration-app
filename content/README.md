1. Open `exercises.js`
2. Find the category array (e.g., `breathing`, `grounding`, `somatic`, etc.)

```javascript
{
  title: "Your Exercise Name",
  steps: [
    "Step 1 instruction",
    "Step 2 instruction",
    "Step 3 instruction"
  ],
  duration: 5,  // time in minutes
  instructions: "What this exercise does and why it's helpful"
}
```

### Editing an Existing Exercise

2. Modify the `title`, `steps`, `duration`, or `instructions`
3. Save the file - changes will appear in the app immediately

### Adding a New Category

```javascript
myNewCategory: [
  {

    steps: [...],
    duration: 5,
    instructions: "..."
  }
]
```

### Editing Existing Content

### Content Structure

Each topic has:
- **id**: Unique identifier (use lowercase with underscores)
- **title**: Display name
- **description**: Brief overview shown on topic card
- **emoji**: Icon for visual identification
- **estimatedTime**: How long to read (e.g., "5 minutes")

  - `title`: Section heading
  - `text`: Section content (can use \n for line breaks, ‚Ä¢ for bullet points)
- **keyTakeaways**: Array of main points (optional)

## üé® Formatting Tips

### Text Formatting

Use plain text with these conventions:
- `\n` for new lines
- `‚Ä¢ ` for bullet points (bullet + space)
- **Bold** won't work in plain strings, but you can use CAPS for emphasis
- Keep paragraphs concise for mobile readability

### Example:
```javascript
text: `This is an introduction paragraph.

Here's a list:
‚Ä¢ First point
‚Ä¢ Second point
‚Ä¢ Third point

And a closing thought.`
```
