# Psychetelia Rebrand Summary

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Previous Name:** Noesis
**New Name:** Psychetelia

---

## Why Psychetelia?

**Psychetelia** (ψυχετελεία) combines:
- **ψυχή** (*psychē*) = soul, mind, spirit
- **τέλος** (*telos*) = purpose, completion, fulfillment
- **-ια** (*-ia*) = state, condition, practice

**Meaning:** "The practice of soul-completion" or "fulfilling the soul's purpose through integration"

### The Perfect Integration Name

Where **psychedelic** (ψυχή + δῆλος) means "soul-revealing" - the experience of consciousness expansion - **Psychetelia** means "soul-completing" - the practice of integration that follows.

It's the natural companion to psychedelic work:
1. **Psychedelic** reveals
2. **Psychetelia** completes

---

## Brand Identity

### Core Values
- **Integration over revelation** - The work begins after the experience
- **Embodiment over insight** - Knowledge becomes wisdom through practice
- **Purpose over experience** - Fulfilling the soul's calling
- **Grounding over expansion** - Bringing insights to earth

### Tagline Options
1. "Soul-completion through psychedelic integration"
2. "Where revelation meets realization"
3. "The practice of becoming whole"
4. "Fulfilling the soul's purpose"
5. "Integration is the real journey"

---

## Design System

The warm, earthy color palette remains the same - it perfectly matches Psychetelia's grounding, integrative mission:

**Primary Colors:**
- Terra Cotta (#D4725C) - Grounding warmth
- Sage Green (#8B9D83) - Calm integration
- Warm Sand (#E8DCC4) - Soft, nurturing backgrounds

**Values:**
- Warm & earthy (not clinical)
- Modern wellness aesthetic
- Accessible & inviting
- Professional yet personal

---

## Marketing Positioning

### Previous (Noesis)
- Focused on "direct knowing" and mystical experience
- Greek philosophical heritage (nous = mind/knowledge)
- Intellectual, somewhat abstract

### New (Psychetelia)
- Focused on integration and embodiment
- Direct parallel to "psychedelic" (instantly understandable)
- Practical, action-oriented while honoring the sacred

### Target Messaging
> "Psychedelics reveal. Psychetelia completes.
> Your companion for integrating transformative experiences into purposeful living."

## Technical Notes

### Next Steps for Complete Rebrand
If you want to fully update all references:

1. Update screen headers and welcome messages
2. Update onboarding carousel text
3. Update README and documentation
4. Create new app icons/logo
5. Update marketing materials
6. Search/replace remaining "Noesis" references

### Slug Decision
We kept the slug as `psychedelic-integration-app` rather than changing to `psychetelia` because:
- The slug is tied to the EAS project ID
- Changing it would break existing EAS configuration
- The descriptive slug is SEO-friendly
- Users don't see the slug, only the app name

## Dictionary Definition

See [design/PSYCHETELIA_DEFINITION.md](design/PSYCHETELIA_DEFINITION.md) for the complete dictionary-style definition including:
- Etymology
- Pronunciation
- Multiple definitions
- Usage examples
- Philosophical framework
- Cultural significance

This can be used for:
- "About" page in the app
- Marketing materials
- Explaining the concept to users
- Educational content

---

## User-Facing Changes

When users see the app now:
- App name displays as "Psychetelia" (not Noesis)
- Package names updated for future builds
- Color scheme and UX remain the same
- Concept shifts from "knowing" to "completing"

---

## Why This Matters

The rebrand from **Noesis** to **Psychetelia** isn't just cosmetic - it refocuses the entire app's mission:

**Before (Noesis):**
- "Direct knowing"
- Mystical, intellectual
- The experience itself

**After (Psychetelia):**
- "Soul-completion"
- Embodied, purposeful
- The integration work that follows

This aligns perfectly with your vision: an app that helps people **do the work** of integration, not just collect insights.
