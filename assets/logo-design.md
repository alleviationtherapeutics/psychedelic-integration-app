# Noesis Logo Design

## Concept
The Noesis logo represents "direct knowing" through integration. The design uses geometric patterns that suggest:
- Consciousness expanding
- Multiple perspectives coming together
- Integration and synthesis
- Journey and navigation

## Primary Logo Mark
A geometric star/compass rose design with 8 points, representing:
- The 8 C's of Self in IFS (Calm, Clarity, Compassion, etc.)
- Cardinal and intercardinal directions (navigation/guidance)
- Expansion of consciousness
- Integration of multiple parts into wholeness

## Symbol: ✦ (Four Pointed Star / Sparkle)
The sparkle/star symbol (✦) serves as a simple, recognizable mark that:
- Represents a moment of insight or "noesis"
- Suggests illumination and clarity
- Works at small sizes (app icons)
- Has mystical/spiritual connotations without being too esoteric
- Easy to render and scale
