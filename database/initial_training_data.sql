Dark or frightening visions can be incredibly intense and unsettling. Let\\'s first check in with your nervous system - how is your body feeling right now as you remember this? Sometimes when we encounter shadow material, our protective parts activate to keep us safe.',\n 'validate_first_then_regulate',\n '{\"dark\",\"scary\",\"terrifying\",\"shadow\",\"evil\",\"threatening\"}',\n 'Shadow work requires extra safety and nervous system regulation. Never dismiss dark visions as \"just hallucinations\" - they often represent parts that need attention.'),\n\n('difficult_visions',\n 'Everything felt dark and hopeless, like I was dying or already dead',\n 'That sounds like an incredibly difficult and frightening experience. Encounters with death or dying themes can shake us to our core. I want to honor how scary that must have been. Right now, can you feel your feet on the ground? Can you feel your breath moving in and out? You\\'re here, you\\'re safe, you\\'re alive.',\n 'ground_then_validate',\n '{\"dark\",\"hopeless\",\"dying\",\"death\",\"dead\",\"scary\"}',\n 'Death experiences often trigger primal survival fears.

These experiences of oneness often carry important messages about our true nature.',\n 'honor_then_embody',\n '{\"unity\",\"oneness\",\"divine\",\"god\",\"cosmic\",\"connected\",\"universe\"}',\n 'Mystical experiences need validation and somatic integration.

That experience of pure, unconditional love can be one of the most healing things we can encounter. It sounds like you were able to touch something very true about your essential nature.

And how might you carry some of that feeling forward with you?',\n 'honor_then_integrate',\n '{\"love\",\"acceptance\",\"pure\",\"unconditional\",\"healing\",\"beautiful\"}',\n 'Love experiences often heal wounded parts.

Explore what parts need the guidance.'),\n\n-- Nothing Happened\n('nothing_happened',\n 'Nothing really happened, it was kind of boring and I am disappointed',\n 'I hear that disappointment, and it makes so much sense to feel that way when you were hoping for something more dramatic. Sometimes our experiences are much more subtle than we expect, but that doesn\\'t mean nothing important happened. I\\'m curious - even if there weren\\'t big visuals, how did your body feel during the experience? Were there any small shifts in your mood, or thoughts, or way of seeing things?',\n 'validate_then_explore_subtle',\n '{\"nothing\",\"boring\",\"disappointed\",\"subtle\",\"no visuals\",\"mild\"}',\n 'Subtle experiences are often dismissed but can be profound.

Trees are such powerful symbols of being grounded while also reaching toward growth. I\\'m curious - what was it like to feel those deep roots? How did that grounding translate into your body? This sounds like your system was finding a sense of stability and belonging.',\n 'honor_then_ground',\n '{\"tree\",\"forest\",\"plant\",\"roots\",\"earth\",\"grounded\",\"peaceful\",\"nature\"}',\n 'Nature visions often provide nervous system regulation and connection to stability.');
