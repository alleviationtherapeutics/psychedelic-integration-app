## 🎨 Changes Applied to Each Screen

### 1. Import Additions
```javascript
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
import { colors, gradients, spacing, borderRadius, shadows } from '../theme/colors';
```

### 2. Root Container Update
**Before:**
```javascript
<View style={styles.container}>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<SafeAreaView style={styles.container} edges={['top', 'bottom']}>
```

This fixes the navigation button overlap issue on ALL screens.

```javascript
<SafeAreaView edges={['top', 'bottom']}>
```

This ensures:

- ✅ Content doesn't hide behind navigation buttons (bottom)
- ✅ Works on all iOS and Android devices
- ✅ Handles notches, dynamic islands, and home indicators

### Color Consistency
Every screen now uses the centralized theme from `theme/colors.js`:
- No more hardcoded hex colors
- Easy to adjust palette app-wide
- Consistent brand identity
- Professional warm/earthy aesthetic

---

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
